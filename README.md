# **Risk Management System**

A comprehensive framework for analyzing the risk of a diversified portfolio. This project calculates key risk metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR), Conditional VaR (CVaR), and Maximum Drawdown (MDD). It also includes stress testing (e.g., COVID-19 crash, hypothetical scenarios) and Monte Carlo simulations to assess portfolio resilience and diversification benefits.

## **Features**
- **Risk Metrics**:
  - **Value at Risk (VaR)**: Historical, Gaussian, and Modified Gaussian methods.
  - **Conditional VaR (CVaR)**: Historical and Gaussian methods to evaluate tail risks.
  - **Maximum Drawdown (MDD)**: Identifies the worst portfolio declines and recovery times.

- **Stress Testing**:
  - Analyze portfolio performance during the **COVID-19 crash** (Feb–Mar 2020).
  - Simulate **hypothetical market shocks**, such as a 10% equity crash.

- **Monte Carlo Simulations**:
  - Generate thousands of random return paths to assess portfolio risk under various scenarios.

- **Diversification Analysis**:
  - Evaluate the impact of diversification on reducing portfolio risk using covariance and correlation matrices.
